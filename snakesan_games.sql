The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.<br/><br/>&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters'' pocket books in mind.<br/><br/>&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the ''Catholic question'' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.<br/><br/>&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;<br/><br/>'),

The game is essentially a batting simulation of major league baseball, built around a spinner and player disks that are divided into sections in such a manner that a hitter has the probabilty of reproducing his real-life statistics in such important categories as home runs, triples, doubles, singles, walks, and strikeouts. In general, the game follows the basic rules of major league baseball.  Teams are created from the player disks supplied with the game (often a mix of current players and all-time greats such as Babe Ruth) and from player disks for other seasons published separately.  The team at bats places the appropriate player disk on the spinner, spins, and reads off the resulting number.  The game does not attempt to realistically simulate pitching and defense.  Thus a hitter''s result from a time at bat is not affected by the opposing pitcher or the defensive prowess of the fielder to whom the ball may be hit, although the player in the field on some play outcomes is required to spin a second spinner to determine the advancement of base runners and other certain details.  Results of each play are recorded on the field using plastic pegs for the base runners, while runs and outs are tallied on a rotating scoreboard.  Cumulative runs scored are tallied on paper score sheets. Strategy discs are included that enable plays like sacrifice flies, stealing bases, bunting, hit and run, etc. The team with the most runs after nine innings (or extra innings, if needed) is the winner.<br/><br/>'),

The two cards are compared: if one is greater the player with the higher card scores double the difference.  Now both players turn over the card on their second cartouche.<br/><br/>The card on the second cartouche does double duty: it determines which player will get to play his remaining cards first (the player with the lowest number goes first), and how many of his opponents'' stones he is allowed to remove. Players can remove 2 of their opponents'' stones if they played a 4 on their second cartouche, 1 for a 3, and 0 for a 2.

A 4 allows activity in any or all of the four temples. A 3 in only the first three temples, a 2 in the first two temples, a 1 in only the first temple. The card on the fourth cartouche determines how many of his own stones he can place that round. The player then removes the appropriate number of his opponents'' stones and places the appropriate number of his own stones. Any removed stones are placed in the Kingdom of the Dead.<br/><br/>The other player now resolves his third and fourth cartouches to finish the round. If the Kingdom of the Dead is full at the end of the round, a scoring round is triggered. For the first temple: the player with the most stones in the 1st temple scores the difference of the number of stones he has in the temple and the number of stones his opponent has placed there. For the second temple: the player with the most stones scores 5 points. For the third temple: the player with the most stones scores 1 point for each stone in that temple. For the fourth temple: the player with the most stones in the temple gets 3 points for each stone he has on a blue square. The player with the most stones on gray squares scores 8 points. Players then score points for any stones on +1 and +2 squares respectively.  If neither player reaches 40 points after the scoring round, play continues with another round of drawing 4 cards, assigning them to cartouches, etc.  If at the end of her turn a player has met one of the winning conditions (filling an entire temple, occupying all of the gold squares or occupying all of the green squares) the game ends with that player the victor.<br/><br/>'),

Each player has a set of 15 &quot;men&quot; that must be moved from their starting positions, around, and then off the board. Dice are thrown each turn, and each player must decide which of his men to move based on the outcome of the roll. Players can capture each other''s men, forcing the captured men to restart their journey around the board. The winner is the first player to get all 15 men off the board. A more recent addition to the game is the &quot;doubling cube&quot;, which allows players to up the stakes of the game, as it is often played for money. Although the game relies on dice to determine movement, there is a large degree of strategy in deciding how to make the most effective moves given each dice roll as well as measuring the risk in terms of possible rolls the opponent may get.<br/><br/>Backgammon may be the first game to be mentioned in written history, going back 5,000 years to the Sumerians of ancient Mesopotamia. During the 1920''s, archaeologists unearthed five boards from a cemetery in the ancient town of Ur. At another location, pieces and dice were also found along with the board. Boards from ancient Egypt have also been recovered from the tomb of Tutanchamun, including a mechanical dice box, no doubt intended to stop cheaters.<br/><br/>The names of the game were many. In Persia, Takhteh Nard&gt; which means &quot;Battle on Wood&quot;. In Egypt, Tau, which may be the ancestor of Senat. In Rome, Ludus Duodecim Scriptorum (&quot;game of twelve marks&quot;), later, Tabula (&quot;table&quot;), and by the sixth century, Alea (&quot;dice&quot;). In ancient China, T-shu-p-u and later in Japan, Sugoroko. The English name may derive from &quot;Bac gamen&quot; meaning &quot;Back Game&quot;, referring to re-entry of taken stones back to the board.<br/><br/>It was often enjoyed by the upper classes and is sometimes called &quot;The Aristocratic Game.&quot; The Roman Emperor Claudius was known to be such a fan that he had a set built into his coach so he could play as he traveled (the world''s first travel edition?).<br/><br/>The rules in English were standardized in 1743 by Edmond Hoyle.

The D54 Game System takes the standard 54-card playing deck (i.e. Jacks, Queens, Kings &amp; Aces of hearts, diamonds, clubs and spades) and adds various sport-specific functions to each card. The D54 Game System provides a level of strategy and skill never before seen in a collectible card game or board game.<br/><br/>Card Football game play combines elements of classic card games including War, Poker and Texas Hold ''Em. Players must decide how best to play their cards. For instance, cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, three-of-a-kind, or five-card poker-style ''Power Hands''. Much like a football coach deciding what play to call, or the quarterback choosing his best option, players must decide whether to play a strong card immediately, or hold it back in hopes of using it to put together a Power Hand.<br/><br/>Other elements of Card Football include team and player chips, the Card Football game board, a score board, a referee/yard marker and dice that are used for fumble, field goal and injury situations.<br/><br/>Card Football allows for one, two, three and four-player modes - a true rarity in the card game market. The single-player game mode is set up so that an individual can take on ''the system'' and pick up the basics of the game before challenging friends in an all-out gridiron battle. In addition, the learning curve with Card Football is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned in two to five minutes, thanks to the built-in familiarity that the D54 Game System offers.<br/><br/>If it happens on the field, you''ll find it in Card Football.

Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board.

In the first phase players roll and move their pieces around the board to visit various sites to look at clue cards so they can figure out the mystery phrase first. Each of these clues require a different mechanism to solve. Some use a mirror to reverse the letters, some use a decoder box that is laid over the card in a certain way to reveal part of the mystery phrase, some cards you line up against a special decoder tool, and some are just riddles or puzzles to solve. Some clues will also require the player to do to the center of the board and visit the library to retrieve a card there with information that will help them solve their clue. Alternately, players might need to visit the Louvre and examine a painting there. When the players visit the Louvre the players only have 30 seconds to find the correct card with the painting that relates to their clue, examine the painting and the information on the card about the painting and hopefully discover the information they need to solve their current clue.<br/><br/>Players can also discover one of two special types of cards: Taxis which let the player move around board quicker and a computer card that lets you look at another player''s notes for 30 seconds.<br/><br/>Once one player thinks they have solved the Mystery Phrase they go to the center of the board and announce the answer. If they are right then all players score 1 point for each letter (and blank space) they had correct in the Mystery Phrase. The player that got the Mystery Phrase correct gets 5 bonus points.<br/><br/>This begins Phase 2 of the game as 5 questions are now read from the mystery book.

There are simple rules governing movement in this array and the players compete for the desirable squares.<br/><br/>Eventually, several times per game, each player has enough squares of a single color to fit them together so that the half-crates all make whole crates.  Now he can make a tea shipment.  This pays off in victory points in three different ways.  First, there is a &quot;demand&quot; award of up to 6 VP depending on how long it has been since anyone shipped this variety.  Second, if the shipment was of at least four crates, there is a flat bonus of 1 VP per crate.<br/><br/>Third and most pivotally, there are VP that will be awarded at the beginning of the player''s next and subsequent turns.  Each tea shipment is represented with cubes of the player''s color (not the tea variety color) on a sort of barge.  The new shipment of tea is always placed, in the other of the two main board areas, at the top of a column of all the recent shipments (the number of total shipments varying with the number of players in the game), so that as more shipments are made, the old shipments drift farther down the column and eventually out of play.  At the beginning of your turn, you look to see where your shipments are in this column, and they pay out VP with better multipliers the higher they still are in the column.

In an interview designer Klaus Teuber stated &quot;As you know there are moments when you close a book really sad that it''s over. After finishing the last page, you often feel like you''ve lost a friend -- to be somewhat melodramatic. So I was looking for a way to keep the book alive a little longer. Creating a game seemed the perfect solution. In this game, I was looking for a way to make riddles, to experiment with shapes and to let the players express their own creativity with clay.&quot;<br/><br/>The game starts with players using modeling clay to make objects that can be guessed by the other players. Players then take turns to move around the board either by rolling a die or spending gems to choose their move. The spaces landed on determine actions. Either the other players receive victory points, or you can ask a letter of an object (What''s the fifth letter of that thing?), or you can ask general questions or make a single guess until you get a NO answer. Players also have three curse stones that they can throw down twice in the game and make a guess.<br/><br/>You make a guess by writing the word down and passing it to the owner, who answers YES or NO. If you guess right, you stick an arrow in the object and score points (5pts if you''re first, 3pts for second correct guess). In addition, and this matters, the object owner can either gain points or lose points, depending on the total arrows sticking at the time. So if you make your object too easy, or too hard, you lose points, but if you get it just right, you gain. Plus, at the game end, objects lacking arrows also lose their owners points.<br/><br/>Your objects must each represent a single specific word, which you note down in secret. Trying to think of two or three things that people will guess, but not too easily, is really tricky and makes Barbarossa a fun game. Hopefully the new edition has a better rules set, as players might get puzzled by the variety of actions.<br/><br/>A later-developed game with similarities to Barbarossa is Cluzzle.<br/><br/>Re-published by Kosmos / Rio Grande 2001.<br/><br/>Republished by Mayfair Games in 2005, in an edition for a maximum of 4 players in a smaller-sized box.<br/><br/>'),

All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.<br/> First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).<br/><br/>With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so.

Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao''s death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China''s slide into radicalism.<br/><br/>The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game''s inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China''s recent political history - but also its past.<br/>Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.<br/><br/>What''s in the box?<br/>Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at <a target=''_blank'' href="http://www.gangoffour.com" rel="nofollow">www.gangoffour.com</a><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>All the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one''s turn a player must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in one''s hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>');

To take a building you must pay its requirements -  some combination of money, workers and building materials. More difficult combinations yield more victory points.<br/><br/>Furthermore, not all of the available buildings on the table are ripe for the taking, as only the ones on the right and left hand border of the 2 rows of buildings are available for selection.<br/><br/>The game''s core mechanic revolves around identical decks of 13 cards for each player, of which only 2 are played per round. But in addition to the card''s function, the numerical combination of cards played is important (e.g. a card with a value of 3 and 4, result in the value 34) as the player with the lowest combined number acts first.<br/><br/>So not only is the start player constantly changing, but it is also possible that a planned action cannot be taken, as another player has already used the same role. Not all roles are exclusive, so the turn order will also determine whether your &quot;half of all pesos in the middle&quot; is half of eight, or half of four (if a player before you played the same card). Some roles allow you to tax others or steal from them, and some cards defend against this, so it''s not all just collecting pieces in a solitary manner. Some combinations require the presence of an architect, so you must choose whether to use one of your two card spots for him. Other cards add different twists. What and when to choose, who to hurt, and what you''re aiming for, make up the game''s main decisions.<br/><br/>These different ideas make Havana its own game even if some of it is familiar. It''s shorter and lighter than many similar games, as well.<br/><br/>'),

Players take turns rolling a die which will determine what kind of challenge they will take. One such challenge involves matching another player''s answer to a fill-in-the-blank question (such as &quot;Nuclear BLANK&quot;). Another challenge has you ranting about a bizarre topic for 30 seconds. This challenge is unique in that rather than earning points right away, players write your color down and give you a score (1-3) on how well you did, and put it into a ballot box. Later in the game if you are unfortunate enough to have to switch colors with someone they all of a sudden will be in control of the points you have in the ballot box. The game continues until one person reaches the finish space, at which point the remaining players have one turn to get as far as possible. Some bonus points are added in to determine the true winner.<br/><br/>What makes this game interesting is that the points you earn are never really yours. In a certain type of challenge, if a challenger wins he can trade colored pawns with the loser of the challenge, which not only affects his position on the board, but can earn him bonus points if that person got lots of votes in his speaking rounds.<br/><br/>'),

Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.<br/><br/>The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player''s turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.<br/><br/>How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player''s illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls.

The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.<br/><br/>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.<br/><br/>The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.<br/><br/>The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;<br/><br/>'),

The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.

If no other player has matched the store owner''s bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.<br/><br/>When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.<br/><br/>When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker''s ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.<br/><br/>Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).

The tales of those legendary pirates of old who''ve fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter''s storm, you set sail to Pirate''s Cove - your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the High Seas.<br/><br/>Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared Pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the Tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome Pirate of the High Seas!<br/><br/>The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the 6 islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.<br/><br/>Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate''s Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.<br/><br/>Each island (except Pirate''s Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).<br/><br/>There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).<br/><br/>Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.<br/><br/>At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &quot;tall tales&quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &quot;pirate&quot; mechanic.

When the trading begins, players offer sets of cards to each other in the hopes of completing a set for themselves.  If you''re successful, you ring the (optional)bell and yell out, &quot;Corner on wheat!&quot; (or whatever your commodity is). You then score points depending on which it was - some are more valuable than others. Two cards labeled Bull and Bear may be used to add wild/penalty cards to the gameplay.<br/><br/>Most editions support up to 8 players, but at least one allows up to 10.<br/><br/>Printings:<br/><br/>    Gavitt Publishing and Printing (1903) (As Gavitt''s Stock Exchange)<br/>    Parker Brothers (1904-???)<br/>    Out of the Box (2004-Present)<br/>    Winning Moves<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Zaster<br/><br/>    Wheedle<br/>    Jurassic Jumble<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Microbadges<br/><br/>(This is the orange desk bell that some versions of Pit came with.)<br/>  Buy This<br/><br/>'),

Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser''s cards into a pool which can score points.<br/><br/>If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead.

You earn a point by reaching certain numbers along tracks, such as at least 7 on the influence track or 8 on the majority track. You also may earn a point by beating your secretly assigned archenemy on three specified tracks.<br/><br/>The game lasts a number of rounds, with each round consisting of a directors'' meeting, followed by 4-7 turns. At the meeting, the &quot;company chairman&quot; is replaced (the next token in line moves up) and the &quot;division heads&quot; are named (by seeing who has the majority in each column of placed cubes). Chairmen and heads get salary bonuses and a card detailing a single advantage for the cardholder.<br/><br/>The player who''s the &quot;communications&quot; head then secretly looks at the Event cards and determines in which order they will be played (and so how many turns will be in the current round). Other heads'' cards will let them pay less for stocks, for example, or place or remove bits.<br/><br/>After each event card is revealed, players select one action to perform, such as &quot;hiring and relocating employees&quot; (placing or moving cubes), resigning as a department head, using an advantage card, or bribing players for their advantage cards. These actions result in points on the scoring tracks and sometimes money (which is only used for bribery and buying blocks of stock). A bribed card has more power than an earned one, giving incentive to accept bribes (the card is less useful or even useless to the original owner, depending on the workers'' happiness scale). In addition to bribery getting you a power you want, it also moves you up the corruption track. A player who rejects a bribe, however, loses one cube on the majority columns.<br/><br/>It''s not a business simulation, and gameplay isn''t as dastardly as the theme implies.

Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player''s turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The ''Exchange'' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The ''Spy'' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards.

This means if the auction is stopped at this position, the winner pays 5 for the item. If no one stops the auction, players place a marker in the ''4 position''. Once again, if the auction is stopped, the winner pays 4 for the item. These rounds continue until the auction is stopped, or until the auction moved to the last ''0 position''. Once the auction for that item is complete, the deck passes to the next player. Each time the deck comes to a player, he collects income as listed on each item card he owns. He may then choose to place an item sold back to the bank up for auction, or draw one from the deck to be auctioned. One thing that makes Shipwrecked stand out from other auction games is that you can''t ''not bid''. You must participate in the auction, even if you really don''t want the item.<br/><br/>'),

The archaeologist who learns the most about the civilizations, claims the greatest-valued artifacts, and collects the most exhibitions will win out over his or her colleagues.<br/><br/>The key element to the game is that it is played out over a period of two (or three) years, and each action a player performs takes a certain amount of time -- traveling is a week between cities, gathering knowledge takes time for the level of the knowledge, and actually digging at a cultural site takes time to yield a certain number of artifact tiles. The game uses a novel mechanism to keep track of this. There is a track of 52 spaces around the outside of the board. Each time a player moves and takes an action, he or she moves their player token forward in time. Players take turns based on being the one who is furthest back in &quot;time.&quot; So, a player can go to an excavation site and spend 10 weeks digging for artifacts, but that will also mean that the other players will likely be taking several actions in the interim while that player waits for the &quot;time&quot; to catch up.<br/><br/>In addition, the artifact tiles for each civilization are drawn from a bag that also contains dirt.  When a player excavates a site, that player pulls tiles from the bag, but some may only be worthless dirt instead of valuable treasure.

Kennedy<br/><br/>In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler''s war machine, while humanity''s most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.<br/><br/>Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower.

Income generated by these enables them to raise armies and to bribe nobles, bishops and ship captains to change allegiance. Players then use secret planning and simultaneous deployment to gain control of the six areas in England and Wales and, hopefully, enough votes in parliament to crown their royal heir as king.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>        Journey back to England, 1450, just prior to the outbreak of the bitter civil war between the Royal Houses of Lancaster and York. Henry VI, a Lancastrian, was proving to be a weak ruler, so the wealthy and ambitious Richard, Duke of York, looked to put things right. The powerful noble families had to choose sides and over the next 40 years, kings, royal heirs, and great nobles were to die, in what was to become known as the Wars of the Roses. Players take on the role of Lancastrians and Yorkists, who must gather support from the major towns and powerful noble families and attempt to control the royal castles throughout the country. Ports, the shipping trade, and financial aid from the Church and France are also needed. As their faction grows in strength, players vie for the King&rsquo;s favor and look to earn the prestigious titles of Captain of Calais, Archbishop of Canterbury, Warden of the Cinque Ports, Lord High Admiral and Constable of the Tower of London. Money means power, because loyalty can be bought, so players should be prepared for the inevitable treachery as nobles change allegiance at crucial times, affecting the balance of power. When Parliament is called, each region in England will support one or other of the two Royal Houses and the crown will go to the one with the greater power base. Nobles loyal to this House will be rewarded by a grateful King. Eventually, only one Royal House will boast the King, but the player who has gathered the most money and prestige will win, regardless of his allegiance.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>'),

The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster. Unfortunately, the game went unnoticed by the game buying public, which is a shame as there''s actually a nifty game inside the box.<br/><br/>There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a ''W'' and ''F'' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.<br/><br/>If a ''W'' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The ''F'' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent''s building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.<br/><br/>When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.<br/><br/>Some have described this game as ''Manhattan lite'', and they''re not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There''s another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an ''F''. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an ''F'' location. Clever.<br/><br/>The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinländer, doesn''t it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player controlling the most deeds is the victor.<br/><br/>'),

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. <br/>Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. <br/>Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes -- mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest.&quot; <br/>Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration and adaptation actions, among others. <br/>All of this eventually leads to the end game -- the final ascent of the ice age -- where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. <br/>But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold....<br/><br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles -- converting them into tundra in the process -- as the ice age encroaches.<br/>The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.<br/>Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animals&rsquo; survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo; -- hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.<br/>Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. <br/>When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile -- after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>Game Development<br/><br/>by Kai Jensen<br/><br/><br/>Components<br/><br/><br/>     a 20-page full-color rulebook<br/>     one 22&quot; x 34&quot; mounted game board<br/>     six Animal Displays<br/>     27 cards<br/>     31 large and 12 small hexagonal tiles used to create &quot;Earth&quot;<br/>     330 wooden cubes in six colors representing the Species belonging to the six Animal groups<br/>     60 wooden cylinders used for the Animals&rsquo; Action Pawns<br/>     60 wooden cones used as the Animals&rsquo; Domination markers<br/>     120 round markers representing the Earth&rsquo;s resources, called &quot;Elements&quot;<br/>     6 square markers used to show each Animal''s &quot;Initiative&quot; (turn order)<br/>     one cloth bag<br/><br/><br/>'),

Sometimes only a dog is helpful, who chases the unwanted cats away. But then too many dogs are worse, too, because they only think about chasing  themselves away. A clever auction game with many interesting decisions.<br/><br/>Idea of the game:  With their mice, the players attempt to grab the famous cat in the sack. In the sack, there are both good and bad cats. Each player can also put a dog or rabbit into the sack instead of a cat, allowing players to bluff one another. At game end, all positive cats and mice count plus  points, but negative cats count minus points.<br/><br/>Contents:  50 game cards, 4 mouse cards, 1 &quot;cat in the sack&quot; card, 1 start player marker, 76 mice money<br/><br/>'),

Each player receives six pieces to start the game, which are placed onto a rack and visible to them alone.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is, through clever placement, to obtain points in the different symbol colours. Points are claimed by placing a piece into any open space such that the symbols on it lie next to already-placed pieces with the same symbol. So, for example, if a player places a piece with a purple circle on it such that it sits next to an unbroken line of four other purple circles already on the board, then the player scores four purple points. A newly placed symbol can lie next to at most five individual rows of symbols.<br/><br/>Each player uses a scoring track to keep track of his points &ndash; one track for each colour going from 0 to 18. If a player reaches the 18th space with any colour, then he gets to call out &ldquo;Genial!&rdquo; and take another turn.<br/><br/>At the end of their turn, players draw as many tiles out of the bag as required to bring their rack back up to six.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more tiles can be placed onto the board.

Take It Easy is a true multi-player solitaire in which each player individually completes a hexagon-shaped board with spots for 19 hexagon tiles.  There''s no limit to number of players if you''ve got enough sets on hand.  One person (the caller) draws a tile randomly and tells the others which of the 27 tiles featuring colored/numbered lines crossing in three directions, with numbers from 1 to 9, it is.  &quot;The 9-8-7,&quot; for example.  Each player then chooses which empty spot on his own board he''ll play the 9-8-7.  This is repeated until the boards are filled.<br/><br/>The idea is to complete same-numbered lines across your board.  Scoring is calculated by multiplying the number on the tile with the number of tiles in the completed line.  A complete column of three 9s is worth 27, for example... but a lot of players will hope for five 9s to fill the big column down the middle.<br/><br/>Take It Easy is often compared to Bingo because of the familiar pattern of a number being called and then everybody looking at their cards to play it, and then scoring if a line is completed.  But that''s as far as the comparison goes.  Bingo is sheer luck; Take It Easy is a game of skill.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Take it to the Limit<br/><br/><br/>'),

It is a somewhat abstracted geopolitical simulation of superpowers'' war of influence in the Middle East --the goal being the control of oil supplies, of course.<br/><br/>The map shows 8 fictitious Middle Eastern oil producing countries, one of which controls the Canal that links both ocean sides. If your superpower is on one ocean and you try to obtain oil from a country bordering on the other ocean, the Canal becomes of vital strategic importance. The alternative is to connect that country to another on the &quot;correct&quot; side of the board (through the land-locked middle countries, which are also bigger producers) with a series of pipelines. To move oil and to build things you must, of course, have a friendly leader in place at the head of that country...<br/><br/>You start with a leader of your color on the capital of a country and one tanker that can transport oil from that country''s port to your country. Oddly, oil is worth more if a certain type of ruler is in place (king or politician versus a dictator or guerrilla). You spend money to move leader pieces about the board, with the &quot;better&quot; pieces costing more. Secret agents also move each turn and are used to defend attacks by blocking the path of opposing leaders and for moving onto &quot;?&quot; spaces to take a gamble on an incident card. Half the cards are favorable and half not. They offer loans, destroy your tanker, allow you to seize a country or cause the death of one of your leaders.<br/><br/>Leaders are ranked in circular fashion, each leader defeating the one ranked below it and being defeated by the one above. Oddly, this crucial rule seems to have slipped from the English text of the rules, at least in the Canadian edition of the game!<br/><br/>To win players must continually take risks and try to depose their opponent while trying to maximize their oil revenue.

The game is a joint work of Leo Colovini and Michael Schacht.<br/><br/>The southern region of Italy was called Magna Grecia and was settled 2,500 years ago by Greek merchants and adventurers. Before the arrival of the Greeks, the country was inhabited by only a few small tribes. Fruitful soil, navigable rivers, large forests, and bronze and silver mines offered enormous development possibilities. Larger cities developed, such as Tarantum, Syracuse, Katane, Locri, and Naxos. In addition, there were numerous villages of which no trace remains. A local road system promoted trade, and rich markets developed in the cities. More and more rivalries between the cities arose, particularly over control of the Oracle, which represented an important source for fame and wealth.<br/><br/>Sufficient material for an evening of play. Each player must successfully settle and develop Magna Grecia. At favorable points, markets are built, villages are developed into cities and interconnected by a road system. Only thus may the interior be opened and the Oracle controlled. Constructing your own large city is often very expensive, and it is sometimes worthwhile to build instead in the neutral villages or opponents'' cities.<br/><br/>The board is covered with a hexagon grid on which pieces of road, towns, or markets are placed. A game is 12 rounds long. Each round is determined by an action map, which is set up at the beginning of play according to a certain pattern. The map specifies the player sequence and indicates to which extent the three basic actions (road construction, city building, and supply) may be used. There are also, of course, certain building rules to be considered. Additionally, markets can be established, the value of which depends on the number of connected locations. The Oracle is shown on the board. In order to control the Oracle, a player must connect one of his own cities to it by road. But if several cities are connected to an Oracle, the most important city takes precedence, determined by the number of locations connected to the city (not including Oracles).<br/><br/>Markets and the Oracle determine when the game ends.<br/><br/>'),

The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.<br/><br/>On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.<br/><br/>Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.<br/><br/>If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.<br/><br/>To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.<br/><br/>If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat.

The exact origins of the game are unknown - there''s probably been gambling using a wheel since the invention of the wheel. Some say it was invented in 1655 by the French scientist Blaise Pascal while working on a perpetual motion machine. Others say it derives from a Chinese game in which player try to move 36 statues into a magic circle. <br/> The Roulette layout that we know today first appeared in 1765 in Paris, but the modern version of the game did not appear until around 1842 when Frenchmen Francois and Louis Blanc are said to have invented the single &quot;0&quot; roulette game. Another mystic legend tells that Francois Blanc, who founded the first casinos in Monte Carlo, sold a soul to the devil for the secret of roulette. As proof, they point out that the sum of all the numbers on a Roulette wheel added together total 666 - the number of the beast.<br/> The single &quot;0&quot; wheel became known as the &quot;French Wheel&quot;. When French immigrants brought the game to America a double zero &quot;00&quot; was also added and this became known as the &quot;American Wheel&quot;. The game became popular in the old west of America during the California Gold Rush.<br/><br/>Modern Roulette is a perfectly balanced wheel with a slot for each number. The numbers alternate between black and red (the 0 and 00 are green) and exactly opposite each other number is the corresponding higher and lower number (0 is opposite the 00, 1 is opposite the 2, and so on up to the 35 being directly opposite the 36). Players may place a multitude of wagers: Single Number pays 35:1, Two Numbers pays 17:1, Three numbers pays 11:1, Four Numbers pays 8:1, Five Numbers (American Wheel) pays 6:1, Six Numbers pays 5:1, Column or Dozen pays 2:1, High/Low Black/Red or Odd/Even pays 1:1. The 0 and 00 are not counted when calculating the odds which gives the house its edge. Ironically, no matter where you place your chips, the house edge remains almost constant (5.26% American Wheel, 2.70% French Wheel).<br/><br/>When all the bets are placed the croupier rolls a little ivory ball along the inner edge of the wheel in the opposite direction of its spin. As the wheel turns, the ball loses momentum, bounces among the slots and finally falls into one of the numbered slots. The number that the ball rests on is the declared as the winning number for that game and winning wagers are paid off. <br/> '),

The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.<br/><br/>Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player''s deck represents their faction''s military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.<br/><br/>While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design.

The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: &ldquo;Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?&rdquo; Meaning: Will you capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do?
